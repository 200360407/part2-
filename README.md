<p>This application is the first step of Part2 for assignment 2 	
which create scaffolded Web API controllers with full
Create-Read-Update-Delete functionality for both tables in my database </p>


<p>I created two tables companies and children.Table "companies" will give information about car list and name, 
on the other 
hand table "children" give me the location and description of car.

Extra work:
1. I use more CSS to change the color of text, size etc.
2. Add external links under buttons "Click for more information."
